            Java is a strongly typed language. This means that all types of variables in addition to having a name and a value necessarily have information on the type of data it will contain. The type allows Java to allocate sufficient memory to hold the data
            We take a box where we stick a small label on what it may contain.
            If a type is too small, it can be declared by a type that can accommodate a larger number, for example an int can be typed long which is lost on 64 bits.

            - double decimal number greater than the float

            - 16-bit short coder (value limit: -32768 to 32767)
            - int is short for integer for an integer of (value limit: -2147483648 to 2147483647). The integer is coded by a binary sequence of 32 bits.
            - long code on 64 bits

            - boolean (true or false)
