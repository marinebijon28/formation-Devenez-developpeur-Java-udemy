            Troubleshoot coding errors
            There are three types of errors:
                - the type of error during compilation
                - the type of error in the interpretation
                - the type of logic error

            There are runtime errors and those that you have to look for yourself.

            # Compile error
            There are syntax errors that make it impossible to compile. You can see a small red light bulb to help fix syntactical errors.

            # Misinterpretation
            In math, you can't divide by 0. The java compiler won't see it. The error message is a Stacktrace. Always read the first line that explains the error. The following is the program history per where the error went. It gives the program history lines related to this error.

            # Logic error
            Code may not work with functional requirements. We talk about logical errors
